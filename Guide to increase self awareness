We increase self awareness simply be observing ourselves.

Therefor we can have a look on four levels regarding our system.


1) Body

How's my body feeling.
Which sensations I'm able to recognize within my body?


2) Emotional Level

How am I feeling in general? Are there any emotions I can identify?


3) Thinking

What do my thoughts say?
What topics catch my attention?
Is my mind jumping or flowing slowly?

4) Actions

What am I doing right now?

What am I doing in general?

Are there patterns in my behavoir I can detect?



When starting this process it's important to say that we can have a lot of sensations on all of these levels and also non at all.
Sensations can be mixed, it can be hard to detect, identify or name them. Usually there can be sensations that we like, dislike or are neutral to us.
Even that is a sensation in itself. You can think about each sensation as one pixel to a greater picture.
To learn, understand and get to know the picture, it can be helpful to have a look on the pixels itself.
Especially if it's hard to understand the greater picture or to get a new perspective.
